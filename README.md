## Introduction

Christian content consumers face annoyances and difficulties in accessing messages of their favourite preachers and discovering their old sermons. Many struggle to find specific messages without knowing exact titles, and downloading features directly to phone internal storage are inadequate for organising content. The current value propositions offer poor experience (no mobile first experience) for our target users. 

Solving these issues is important to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience, allowing users to efficiently access, manage, and discover religious content, thereby enhancing their spiritual growth and connection.

To build this enhanced product experience, we asking the following questions:
- How can we eliminate the frustration of people in searching, listening and sharing sermons on the go? 
- How can we help people feel organised and free from the clutter of downloaded sermon collections to make more space for other items? ~ Allow me the freedom to carry my entire sermon collection in my pocket.
- How can we help people gain control of their spiritual life by listening to sermons seamlessly so that they can improve their lifestyle?
- How can we help people to share a common spiritual experience by sharing messages to their loved ones on their mobile device?
